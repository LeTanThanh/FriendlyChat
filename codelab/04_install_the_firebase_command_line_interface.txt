04. INSTALL THE FIREBASE COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

The Firebase command line interface (CLI) allows you to use Firebase Hosting to serve your web app locally
as well as to deploy your web app to your Firebase project.

Note: To install the CLI, you need to install npm which typically comes with NodeJS.

1. Install the CLI by running the following npm command:
  npm -g install firebase-tools

2. Verify that CLI has been installed corectly by running the following command:
  firebase --version

  Make sure the version of the Firebase CLI Ã­ v4.1.0 or later.

3. Authorize the Firebase CLI by running the following command:
  firebase login

  We've set up the web app template to pull your app's configuration for Firebase Hosting from your app's local directory 
  (the repository that you cloned earlier in the codelab).
  But to pull the configuration, we need to associated your app with yout Firebase project.

4. Make sure that your command line is accessing your app's local web-start directory.

5. Associated your app with your Firebase project by running the following command.

  firebase use --add

6. When prompt, select your project ID, then give your Firebase project an alias

  An alias is useful if you gave multiple environments (production, staging, etc).
  However, for this codelab, let's just use the alias of default.

7. Following the remaining instructions in your command line.
