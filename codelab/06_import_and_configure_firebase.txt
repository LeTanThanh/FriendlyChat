06. IMPORT AND CONFIGURE FIREBASE

IMPORT THE FIREBASE SDK

We need to import the Firebase SDK into teh app,
For instance, you can import the library from our CDN,
or you can install it locally using npm, then package it in your app if you're using Browserify.

Since we're using Firebase Hosting to serve our app, we're going to import the local URLs that are in the file index.html (located in your web-start/public directory). 
For this codelab, we've already added the following lines for you at the bottom of the index.html file, but you can double check that they are there.

index.html

<script src="/__/firebase/6.0.4/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="/__/firebase/6.0.4/firebase-auth.js"></script>
<script src="/__/firebase/6.0.4/firebase-storage.js"></script>
<script src="/__/firebase/6.0.4/firebase-messaging.js"></script>
<script src="/__/firebase/6.0.4/firebase-firestore.js"></script>
<script src="/__/firebase/6.0.4/firebase-performance.js"></script>

FYI the version number might ne newer in your sample code. as the version is automatically updated in that code.

During this codelab, we're going to use Firebase Auth, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Messaging and Performance Monitoring
so we're importing all of their libraries. 
In the future apps, make sure that you're only importing the parts of Firebase that you need in order to shorted the load time of app.

CONFIGURE FIREBASE

We also need to configure the Firebase SDK to tell it which Firebase project that we're using.
Since we're using Firebase Hosting, you can import a special script thay will do this configuration for you.
Again, for this codelab, we're already added the following line for you at the bottom of the public/index.html file.
but double check that it is there.

index.html

<script src="/__/firebase/init.js"></script>

This script contains your Firebase project configuration based upon the Firebase project that you specified earlier when you ran firebase use --add.

Fell free to inspect the file init.js to see what your project configuration looks like.
To do this, open https://localhost:3000/__/firebase/init.js in your browser.
