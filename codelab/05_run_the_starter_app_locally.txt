05. RUN THE STARTER APP LOCALLY

Now that you have imported and configured your project, you are ready to run the web app for the first time.

1. In a console from thw web-start directory, run the following Firebase CLI comamnd:

firebase serve --only hosting

2. Your command line should display the following response:

hosting: Local server: http://localhost:5000

We're using the Firebase Hosting emulator to serve our app locally.
The web app should now be available from http://localhost:5000. 
All the files that are located in public subdirectory are served.

3. Using your browser, open your app at http://localhost:5000

Let's now build a real time chat!
